Welcome to Day 6 of 14 Days of Data Science, a countdown to Data Science Day on March 14th.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subfield of Data Science and is at the heart of many AI technologies that have become popular in recent years. There are various types of Machine Learning, along with many different algorithms and processes used within it.

When performing Machine Learning, a computational model is created by learning from data and identifying patterns. With this model, predictions or decisions can be made programmatically without explicitly programming the logic or answers the user will receive.

## What is ***Supervised*** Machine Learning?
Supervised machine learning is a core concept in AI, where algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. The data provided for training includes both input features and corresponding output labels. The goal is to teach the algorithm to recognize patterns in the data so it can generalize and make predictions on new, unseen data. Tasks like classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting values) fall under supervised learning. It's used in various fields like image recognition, identifying spam emails, and more. The success of supervised learning hinges on having high-quality labeled data and selecting suitable algorithms and models

## When should you use supervised Machine Learning?

## What kinds of supervised Machine Learning are there?

## What's Next?

Tomorrow, you'll explore another side of Machine Learning when we take a look at unsupervised machine learning and how you can use that.
