Welcome to Day 7 of 14 Days of Data Science, a countdown to Data Science Day on March 14th.

## What is ***Supervised*** Machine Learning?
Unsupervised machine learning stands as a cornerstone of modern data science, offering a unique approach to uncovering hidden structures and relationships within data. 

Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled data to make predictions, unsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data, allowing algorithms to identify patterns and clusters autonomously. This makes it particularly well-suited for exploratory data analysis, working with data with many dimensions, such as images, and anomaly detection tasks where it can infer normal and abnormal behaviours from statistical distributions in unlabeled data.
