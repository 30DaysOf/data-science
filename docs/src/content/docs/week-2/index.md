## Table Of Contents

Welcome to week 2 of the data science learning journey. This week, we'll focus on the developer experience as you progress through the data science lifecycle (to build models) and introduce the paradigm shift to LLM Ops when exploring generative AI solutions that work with Large Language Models (LLMs). Each day this week, we'll introduce a tool, platform or resource that can help _streamline_ your end-to-end workflow.

| Day | Topic | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1️⃣ | **GitHub Codespaces** | Pre-built & reproducible dev environments for productivity |
| 2️⃣ | **Visual Studio Code** | Enhanced & shareable profiles for consistency, collaboration |
| 3️⃣ | **GitHub Copilot** | Focused learning with AI-assisted coaching and exploration |
| 4️⃣ | **Open Datasets** | Learn from OSS communities like Kaggle & Hugging Face |
| 5️⃣ | **Responsible AI** | Explore the toolkit for model debugging and decision making |
| 6️⃣ | **Project LIDA** | Explore tools for AI-assisted data visualization & summarization |
| 7️⃣ | **Azure AI Platform** | Make the paradigm shift to LLM Ops with a unified platform |
