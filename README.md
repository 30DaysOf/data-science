# Learn with #30DaysOfAstro

## 1. Learning Objectives

- Understand core Astro concepts
- Learn core Astro tooling
- Build, test & deploy an Astro project
- Use Astro Starlight as documentation framework

## 2. Dev Container

The project is instrumented with a `devcontainer.json` intended for Node.js projects. For convenience, we're using the [Playwright Docker Image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker#introduction) which also gives us the Playwright testing harness by default. 

Let's check our tooling versions (this should trigger installs automatically if required).

```bash
node --version
v20.11.0

npm --version
10.4.0

npx playwright --version
Version 1.41.1

npx astro --version
astro  v4.2.6
```

## 3. Astro Starlight Setup

[Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) is the Astro theme for documentation. We'll use this to create a documentation site for recording the learning journey under the `docs/` folder. Check out [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md) for more details.

To preview the documentation site:
```bash
cd docs;
npm install && npm run dev
```

## 4. 30DaysOf Roadmap

Learn Astro through a series of small projects that teach different concepts.
